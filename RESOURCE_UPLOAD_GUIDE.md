# Resource Upload Pipeline Guide

This guide explains how to seamlessly upload blogs and videos to your Resources tab using the complete pipeline we've built.

## üèóÔ∏è What We've Built

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Resource Model** (`backend/models/Resource.js`): Complete database schema for blogs and videos
- **API Endpoints** (`backend/routes/resources.js`): Full CRUD operations for resource management
- **Admin Interface** (`app/admin/resources/page.tsx`): User-friendly form for creating and editing content

### Frontend Integration
- **Resources Page** (`app/resources/page.tsx`): Dynamic display of content from the database
- **Search & Filtering**: Real-time search and category/tag filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Database

First, ensure your MongoDB is running and configured:

```bash
# Install MongoDB dependencies (if not already done)
cd backend
npm install mongoose

# Set up your environment variables
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB connection string
```

### 2. Seed Sample Data

Run the seeding script to populate your database with sample content:

```bash
# From the project root
node scripts/seed-resources.js
```

This will create:
- 2 sample blog posts with full content
- 1 sample video resource
- Proper metadata and SEO fields

### 3. Start Your Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend
npm run dev
```

## üìù How to Upload Content

### Option 1: Admin Interface (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to Admin Panel**
   ```

   ```

2. **Create New Resource**
   - Click "Add New Resource"
   - Fill out the form with your content

4. **For Videos**

### Option 2: API Direct Upload

You can also create resources programmatically using the API:

const response = await fetch('/api/resources', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Your Blog Title',
    description: 'Brief description of your content',
    category: 'blogs',
    type: 'Blog',
    content: {
      body: '# Your Markdown Content\n\nWrite your blog post here...'
    },
    image: '/path/to/your/image.jpg',
    tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
    featured: false,
    status: 'published',
    author: {
      name: 'Your Name',
      bio: 'Your bio',
      avatar: '/path/to/avatar.jpg'
